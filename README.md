# Digital Agency

This is a digital agency website that is meant to display my ability to take a mockup and or design from a designer, in this case, the website design of jumor digital agency, and make it into a website.There is a slight variation comparing it to the original and that is because I didn't actually have any mockup or design file, it's strictly made based on what I could observe on their website.
